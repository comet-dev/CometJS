## Get Started

CometJS is simple software development for building desktop applications.

CometJS specializes in creating applications, but can also host them in a browser window. This practically sets it apart from the other popular frameworks, however, the app must be tested on the "web". Comet sends your app to a server (through desktop), but the common server is 1.100.COMET. From there, your app is public to share with the world from the "web" (on desktop, web window).

To test if your app is valid, use: ```comet test <app>```
> Note: CometJS is still in development!

CometJS is simply front-end desktop development, user interaction in all (Comet's UI), and precise back-end desktop development, with plugins and apis working coherently in pure javascript in order to keep the easy workflow. With the back-end desktop development, CometJS is running on Chromium, with some Firefox implementations. Running on Firefox source code makes it unique, so that there is two ways running an app meets the eye.

And the best parts of all are:
- You can run apps in **Javascript**
- You can deploy them on a running Javascript client-side foundation.
- All the binaries you need in one place(account for most of what keeps CometJS functional).
- A mini-cloud, server and nothing more secure, since it is on the desktop.

## Downloads
On the contrary, [npm install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/CometJS) CometJS and get started. In addition, when you install CometJS, be sure you also install it's [cli](https://github.com/comet-dev/cli) as well. 
```sh
# npm install Comet locally or globally to your PATH
npm install comet

# install the cli
npm install comet-cli
```
```sh
# Example for creating an app
comet new my-app
cd my-app
comet serve my-app.comet.com
```
