## Get Started

CometJS specializes in creating applications, but can also host them. This practically sets it apart from the other popular frameworks, however, the app must be tested on the web.

To test if your app is valid, use: ```comet test <app>```
> Note: Don't hate me, but CometJS is still in development(what do you expect, I am the only one working on this)!

## Usage

On the contrary, lets keep things **real**. Install CometJS and the comet-cli and lets get this party rolling!
```sh
npm install cometjs
npm install cli
```
```sh
# comet cli
comet new my-app
comet my-app init
```

## Work in Progress
- Comet has not been tested within the desktop...
- Comet Shell package and commands has not been worked on.
