## Overview

CometJS is simple software development for building desktop applications.

It can specialize in creating applications, as well as previewing them in a browser window. This practically sets it apart from the other popular JS frameworks. Comet sends your app to a server (through the desktop) in a intuitive window, on Windows, Mac, or Linux. From there, your app is public to share with the world from the desktop as if it were a platform made on ice!

To test if your app is valid, use: ```comet test <app>```

CometJS is simply front-end desktop development, user interaction in all (Comet's UI), and precise back-end desktop development, with plugins and apis working coherently in pure javascript in order to keep the easy workflow. With the back-end desktop development, CometJS is running on Chromium, with some Firefox implementations. Running on Firefox makes it unique, so that there is two ways running an app meets the eye.

And the best parts of all are:
- You can run apps in **Javascript**.
- You can deploy them on a running Javascript client-side foundation.
- All the binaries you need in one place.

## Downloads
[Npm install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/CometJS) CometJS and get started, but be sure you also install it's [cli](https://github.com/comet-dev/cli) as well. 
```sh
# npm install Comet locally or globally to your PATH
npm install comet-dev

# install the cli and ices
npm install comet-cli
npm install ices
```
```sh
# Example for creating an app
comet new my-app
cd my-app
comet serve my-app.comet.com
```
